# Zero-day-just-a-prototype

The above given files are just a prototype of project DETECTIVE ZERO-DAY (Web-Application). The application's frontend part is done using ReactJS in the folder "zero-day" where we'll be running "npm start" to run the frontend server. Coming to the backend fastAPI is used and all the models are deployed in the backend. To run the backend successfully without any exceptions we'll have to install the requirements "requirements.txt" by running the command "pip install -r requirements.txt". Then start the backend server using the command "uvicorn mlapi:app --reload". after starting the backend and frontend servers successfully. use the given sample CSV files to upload to the website to obtain results.   

make sure you update the port number of your backend server in the ./zeroday/src/App.js if it is other than localhost:8000. (generally, backend servers run on localhost:8000)

It is agreed that the front-end user interface looks ridiculous. but again the projet is still in development stage and these are just to show a working prototype of the project.
